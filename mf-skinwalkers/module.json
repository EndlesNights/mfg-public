	"description": "<p>Trapped and surrounded on all sides, the party must fight throughout the night against a pack of vicious lycanthropes â€“ but in truth, it is the threat from within that might lead them to ruin. Haunted pasts, conflicting agendas, and long-nursed grudges combine to fill them with doubt and mistrust. Stay on your guard and place your trust carefully if you are to have any hope of surviving the <strong>Curse of the Skinwalkers.</strong></p><p>This module is a 5e adventure designed for a party of four to five <strong>level 5 characters</strong>, built to be plugged easily into an existing campaign or as a stand-alone adventure. The adventure is a self-contained story that combines classic horror with the mystery and paranoia of a cabin-fever tale. The characters must fight to survive against a pack of ravenous lycanthropes, while navigating the tense atmosphere that brews around them and the NPCs that populate the adventure. Haunted pasts, conflicting agendas, and long-nursed grudges combine to fill the characters with doubt and mistrust.</p>",
